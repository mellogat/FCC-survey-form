# FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and demonstrates the creation of a survey form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to apply web development concepts learned in the curriculum to design and build an interactive and responsive survey form.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a survey form that collects user input through various form fields. The form consists of different input elements, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button.
